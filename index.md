          This is a space for ideas, experiments, and thoughts around AI, finance, and what happens when the two collide.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe AI is going to fundamentally change finance teams â€” not just in productivity, but in how we think, plan, and make decisions. I'm here to share what I'm learning as I apply AI tools in real finance work, and hopefully learn from others doing the same.

          Right now, I lead finance at Airwallex, a fintech company building the future of global banking. We're valued at $6.2B and growing fast.

          Before this, I was a tech investment banker at Morgan Stanley and Citi, helping founders in China and Southeast Asia with strategy, fundraising, and IPOs.

          In between, I started and sold a web and mobile dev agency that grew to a team of 20+ engineers and designers, where I shipped products for funded startups to multinational companies.

          I studied financial engineering at Columbia and have always been a builder at heart.
