## Observations

- **User interface revolution**: I haven't seen the user interface revolution in accounting and spend software that we've seen in software engineering (Lovable, Cursor). Many modern accounting and FP&A startups are still module driven rather than AI native.

- **Adoption follows complexity**: Adoption should start with simple operations (AP/AR automation) and move to complex analysis (strategic finance) as better models are released.

- **Suite advantage**: Microsoft and Google have a structural advantage in financial tasks because the AI agent can integrate seamlessly with existing workflows in Excel / Sheets, Word / Docs and Powerpoint / Slides that finance teams already use daily.
