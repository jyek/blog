Gen AI is reshaping the office of the CFOs and startups and projects are emerging. This is a live article that lays them out.

## What to Expect from Gen AI Finance Apps

**Address the last-mile**: Finance automation already handles the bulk work—OCR, reconciliation, treasury. Gen AI will tackle what still happens on calls and spreadsheets: edge case journals, month-end flux analysis, complex accruals.

**User interface revolution**: Most CFO software predates dynamic UI. The next generation will replace hard-coded configurations with agentic workflows and dynamic dashboards.

**Work where finance teams live**: Tools that work with Microsoft and Google have structural advantages. Finance teams spend their day in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Just like Cursor and Claude Code work alongside engineers in their code editor, AI that works natively in these environments wins.

**Disrupt from simple to complex**: Start with analyst tasks—AP/AR automation, variance analysis, basic dashboards. Move to complex modeling and decision-making as models improve.
